# Navigation!

Here i managed to create a simple app containing Stack, Tab and Drawer Navigation.
I studied the nesting navigation documentation and the principles on which react navigation works.

I needed Tab buttons and header, so i used the Drawer Navigation for the header and Tab navigation for the bottom buttons. I intend to use the Stack navigation for products/posts components. ( e-commerce / social media app alike )

I used the following hierarchy for navigation:
  Tab Navigation -> Stack Navigation -> Drawer Navigation
  
I still have to work on the Stack screen because i don't like the double header in the details screen. Maybe i will add a button that navigates back to the feed screen.

For the sake of beauty i added Feather icons to the Tab Navigation

9 March 2020 Edit: 
I figured out my personal solution for merging three navigators in this app.

Changed the hierarchy to Stack Navigation -> Tab Navigation -> Drawer Navigation.
I added Tab Screens icon configuration.

I added header title switch cases for every tab screen.
